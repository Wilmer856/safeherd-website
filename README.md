# Animal Classification Web Application

## Summary

This project develops a machine learning-based web application aimed at distinguishing domestic animals from predators. Utilizing advanced AI algorithms, it analyzes various animal characteristics to categorize them accurately. Designed for educational and research purposes, the platform allows users to input animal data and receive instant classification. It features a user-friendly interface for data submission and displays results in a clear, concise manner. This application serves as a practical tool for understanding animal behaviors and characteristics, highlighting the potential of AI in wildlife study and education.

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Python with TensorFlow for machine learning model, assisting in data analysis and prediction capabilities.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs for efficient communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Data**: The machine learning model is trained on a dataset of animal characteristics for accurate classification.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation of the model's architecture and training process is available in the project's GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Wilmer856/animal-binary-classification).

## Future Improvements

Currently, the website features a button for generating random images to classify. A future enhancement will include the capability for users to upload their own images for classification.
